## üéØ Property Overview

**Property URI**: `gmn:P70_22_indicates_receiving_party`

**Label**: "P70.22 indicates receiving party" (English)

**Purpose**: Simplified property for associating a document with the person or entity receiving something in the documented activity. This is a multi-purpose property used across four different document types with context-dependent semantics.

**Document Types Supported**:
- **Cession of Rights Contracts** (`gmn:E31_4_Cession_of_Rights_Contract`) - party receiving the ceded rights
- **Declarations** (`gmn:E31_5_Declaration`) - party to whom the declaration is addressed
- **Donation Contracts** (`gmn:E31_7_Donation_Contract`) - donee receiving the donated property
- **Dowry Contracts** (`gmn:E31_8_Dowry_Contract`) - party receiving the dowry property

**CIDOC-CRM Transformation Paths**:
- **For Declarations**: `E31_Document > P70_documents > E7_Activity > P01_has_domain > E39_Actor`
- **For Cessions, Donations, and Dowries**: `E31_Document > P70_documents > E8_Acquisition > P22_transferred_title_to > E39_Actor`

## ‚úÖ Quick-Start Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Ontology Update
- [ ] Open `gmn_ontology.ttl`
- [ ] Locate the property definition section for P70.22
- [ ] Replace existing definition with updated version from `indicates-receiving-party-ontology.ttl`
- [ ] Verify TTL syntax with validator
- [ ] Commit changes with message: "Updated P70.22 indicates receiving party property"

### Phase 2: Python Transformation Script Update
- [ ] Open `gmn_to_cidoc_transform.py`
- [ ] Locate the `transform_p70_22_indicates_receiving_party()` function
- [ ] Replace existing function with version from `indicates-receiving-party-transform.py`
- [ ] Update `transform_item()` to ensure function is called
- [ ] Verify imports include `uuid` module

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Create test data for each document type (cession, declaration, donation, dowry)
- [ ] Run transformation script on test data
- [ ] Verify correct CIDOC-CRM paths for each document type
- [ ] Check that E8_Acquisition is used for cessions, donations, and dowries
- [ ] Check that E7_Activity is used for declarations
- [ ] Validate all output URIs are properly generated

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates
- [ ] Review `indicates-receiving-party-doc-note.txt`
- [ ] Add examples to relevant documentation files:
  - Cession of rights documentation
  - Declaration documentation
  - Donation documentation (`donation-documentation.md`)
  - Dowry documentation (`dowry-documentation.md`)
- [ ] Update comparison tables if present
- [ ] Add cross-references between related properties

### Phase 5: Validation and Deployment
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Validate transformed output against CIDOC-CRM specification
- [ ] Review edge cases (multiple receiving parties, complex document types)
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Update user-facing documentation

## üìä Implementation Summary

### Key Characteristics

1. **Multi-Context Property**: Unlike most GMN shortcut properties that serve a single document type, P70.22 is shared across four different document types with semantically appropriate transformations for each.

2. **Dual Transformation Paths**: 
   - **E8_Acquisition Path** (for ownership/rights transfer): Used for cessions, donations, and dowries where the receiving party acquires ownership or legal rights
   - **E7_Activity Path** (for communication): Used for declarations where the recipient is the target/addressee of the communication

3. **Semantic Precision**: The transformation intelligently determines which CIDOC-CRM path to use based on the document type, ensuring semantic accuracy.

### Integration Points

**Related Properties**:
- `gmn:P70_21_indicates_conceding_party` - Complementary property for cessions (the party transferring rights)
- `gmn:P70_32_indicates_donor` - Complementary property for donations and dowries (the party giving property)
- `gmn:P70_23_indicates_object_of_cession` - Specifies what rights are being transferred in cessions
- `gmn:P70_33_indicates_object_of_donation` - Specifies what property is being donated
- `gmn:P70_34_indicates_object_of_dowry` - Specifies what property is being transferred as dowry

**Shared E8_Acquisition Node**:
For donations and dowries, the transformation creates or references a shared E8_Acquisition node that connects:
- P23 (donor) via `P70_32_indicates_donor`
- P22 (receiving party) via `P70_22_indicates_receiving_party`
- P24 (object) via `P70_33_indicates_object_of_donation` or `P70_34_indicates_object_of_dowry`

### Common Use Cases

1. **Cession Contract**: Recording the party acquiring rights in a rights transfer agreement
2. **Declaration Document**: Identifying the addressee or target of a formal declaration
3. **Donation Contract**: Documenting the donee (recipient) of gifted property
4. **Dowry Contract**: Identifying the spouse or couple receiving dowry property in a marriage arrangement

## üîç Property Semantics by Document Type

### In Cession of Rights Contracts
The receiving party is the actor who **acquires legal rights** being transferred. This could be:
- Rights to collect debts
- Usufruct rights
- Ownership rights
- Contractual claims
- Any other legal interests

### In Declarations
The receiving party is the **addressee or target** of the declaration. This is:
- The party to whom the statement is directed
- Often the party affected by the declaration
- Distinct from the declarant (who makes the declaration)

### In Donation Contracts
The receiving party is the **donee** - the beneficiary who receives donated property without payment. This could be:
- Religious institutions
- Family members
- Charitable organizations
- Any party receiving a voluntary gift

### In Dowry Contracts
The receiving party is the **spouse or couple** who receives dowry property as part of a marriage arrangement. This is:
- Often the husband or the married couple jointly
- Distinguished from the donor (often a parent or family member)
- Part of a specific marriage context

## üöÄ Quick Implementation Example

### Input (Shortcut Form)
```turtle
<donation001> a gmn:E31_7_Donation_Contract ;
    gmn:P70_32_indicates_donor <widow_maria> ;
    gmn:P70_22_indicates_receiving_party <hospital_pammatone> ;
    gmn:P70_33_indicates_object_of_donation <building_chapel> .
```

### Output (CIDOC-CRM Compliant)
```turtle
<donation001> a gmn:E31_7_Donation_Contract ;
    cidoc:P70_documents <donation001/acquisition> .

<donation001/acquisition> a cidoc:E8_Acquisition ;
    cidoc:P23_transferred_title_from <widow_maria> ;
    cidoc:P22_transferred_title_to <hospital_pammatone> ;
    cidoc:P24_transferred_title_of <building_chapel> .
```

## üìö Additional Resources

- **CIDOC-CRM Documentation**: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/
- **P22 transferred title to**: Used in acquisition transformations
- **P01 has domain**: Used in declaration transformations
- **GMN Ontology Documentation**: See project documentation files
- **Related Document Types**: See `donation-documentation.md`, `dowry-documentation.md`

---

## üÜò Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wrong transformation path**: Ensure document type is correctly specified with proper class URI
2. **Missing E8_Acquisition**: Check that acquisition node is created before adding P22 relationships
3. **Type conflicts**: Verify that only one document type is assigned to each document instance

### Validation Checklist

‚úì Property definition includes all four document types in domain union  
‚úì Transformation function checks document type before selecting path  
‚úì E8_Acquisition nodes are properly shared across related properties  
‚úì Actor instances have proper E39_Actor typing  
‚úì URIs are consistently generated using document base URI
