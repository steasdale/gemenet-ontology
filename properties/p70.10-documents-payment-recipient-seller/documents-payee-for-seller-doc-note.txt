### P70.10 documents payment recipient for seller

**Property URI**: `gmn:P70_10_documents_payment_recipient_for_seller`

**Label**: "P70.10 documents payment recipient for seller"

**Domain**: `gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract`

**Range**: `cidoc:E21_Person`

**Definition**: Associates a sales contract with a third party who receives the payment (funds) on behalf of the seller.

**Purpose**: Documents situations where payment for a sale is received by someone other than the seller themselves, particularly in cases involving family members, business partners, or creditors.

**Historical Context**: In medieval and early modern transactions, payment recipients served various functions: adult children receiving payment for elderly parents, business partners collecting payment for shared ventures, creditors receiving direct payment to settle debts, and estate executors collecting funds on behalf of estates.

**Distinction from Related Roles**:
- **Payment Recipient**: Receives actual funds on behalf of seller
- **Procurator (P70.4)**: Legal representative with formal power of attorney
- **Guarantor (P70.6)**: Security provider with contingent payment obligation
- **Broker (P70.8)**: Transaction facilitator receiving commission only

# ============================================================================
# DATA ENTRY GUIDELINES (Add to User Guide Section)
# ============================================================================

## Guidelines for Documenting Payment Recipients

### When to Use P70.10

Use `gmn:P70_10_documents_payment_recipient_for_seller` when:

1. **Contract explicitly names** a person who will receive payment
2. **Person is distinct** from the seller
3. **Person's primary role** is to receive funds (not just to facilitate or represent)
4. **Historical record indicates** authorized receipt of payment

### When NOT to Use P70.10

Do NOT use this property when:

1. **Person is the seller** themselves (redundant)
2. **Person is a procurator** who happens to collect payment (use P70.4)
3. **Person is a guarantor** who only receives payment conditionally (use P70.6)
4. **Person is a broker** who receives commission only (use P70.8)
5. **No explicit authorization** or documentation of payment receipt

### Data Entry Best Practices

**1. Identify the Recipient Correctly**
- Extract the exact name as written in the source document
- Create or link to the person's entity in your person registry
- Verify the person is not already documented in another role

**2. Document the Relationship**
- Use `gmn:has_payment_received_by` to link seller to recipient
- Add annotations explaining the relationship (family member, creditor, etc.)
- Note any conditions or amounts if specified

**3. Provide Context**
- Include sale price (P70.16) when payment recipient is documented
- Note if payment is split among multiple recipients
- Document any special conditions or arrangements

**4. Quality Control**
- Verify recipient is not also the buyer
- Check that seller is also documented
- Ensure person URIs are consistent across the dataset

### Example Data Entry Workflow

```
Step 1: Read the contract text
"...Giovanni sells to Marco for 500 florins, payment to be received 
by Giovanni's son Antonio..."

Step 2: Identify the entities
- Seller: Giovanni (create/find person:Giovanni)
- Buyer: Marco (create/find person:Marco)
- Payment Recipient: Antonio (create/find person:Antonio)

Step 3: Enter the data
contract:xyz gmn:P70_1_documents_seller person:Giovanni ;
            gmn:P70_2_documents_buyer person:Marco ;
            gmn:P70_10_documents_payment_recipient_for_seller person:Antonio ;
            gmn:P70_16_documents_sale_price_amount "500"^^xsd:decimal .

Step 4: Add supporting relationships
person:Giovanni gmn:has_payment_received_by person:Antonio .

Step 5: Add annotations (optional but recommended)
person:Antonio rdfs:comment "Son of Giovanni, received payment on father's behalf" .
```

# ============================================================================
# VALIDATION RULES (Add to Validation Section)
# ============================================================================

## Validation Rules for P70.10

### Structural Validation

1. **Domain Check**: Subject must be `gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract`
2. **Range Check**: Object must be `cidoc:E21_Person`
3. **Cardinality**: 0 or more (multiple recipients allowed)
4. **Format**: Must be URI reference or object with @id

### Semantic Validation

5. **Uniqueness**: Recipient should not be the same person as seller
6. **Consistency**: If recipient documented, seller should also be documented
7. **Completeness**: Consider documenting sale price when recipient is noted
8. **Context**: Verify recipient role is appropriate (not procurator/guarantor/broker)

### Transformation Validation

9. **Activity Creation**: Each recipient must generate one E7_Activity
10. **Activity Type**: Each activity must have AAT financial transaction type
11. **Actor Link**: Each activity must link recipient via P14_carried_out_by
12. **Role Specification**: Each activity must include P14.1 with AAT payee role
13. **Cleanup**: Original P70.10 property must be removed after transformation

### Example Validation Errors

**Error 1: Recipient is also seller**
```turtle

## Historical Context for Payment Recipients

### Medieval and Renaissance Commercial Practice

In medieval and Renaissance commercial transactions, the person receiving payment was not always the seller themselves. This practice reflected several social and economic realities:

**Family Structure**: Extended family networks meant that transactions often involved multiple family members. Elderly parents might conduct sales while having adult children handle the financial aspects.

**Debt Settlement**: Creditors had strong legal standing to demand direct payment from the debtor's transactions. Contracts would frequently specify that payment go directly to a creditor to settle outstanding obligations.

**Partnership Arrangements**: Business partnerships were common, with one partner often managing financial transactions for the group. Payment collection was frequently delegated to the partner handling accounts.

**Estate Administration**: When estates were sold, executors managed transactions but payments were often directed to heirs or other beneficiaries.

**Trust Arrangements**: Wealthy individuals sometimes had trusted agents or family members who managed their financial affairs, including receipt of payments from sales.

### Legal Framework

The practice of designating payment recipients was well-established in medieval commercial law:

- **Authorization**: The seller's authorization could be explicit (stated in the contract) or implicit (understood from social relationships)
- **Receipt Requirements**: Payment to a designated recipient was legally binding, freeing the buyer from further obligation
- **Liability**: The designated recipient bore responsibility for proper distribution or use of funds
- **Documentation**: Notarial records carefully documented payment arrangements to prevent disputes

### Archival Evidence

Common formulaic language in notarial contracts:
- "...payment to be made to..." (Italian: "...pagamento da farsi a...")
- "...received by..." (Italian: "...ricevuto da...")
- "...collected on behalf of..." (Italian: "...riscosso per conto di...")
