This captures places that appear in the contract narrative such as neighboring properties used for boundary descriptions, landmarks referenced for location, districts or parishes mentioned, or any other geographic locations named in the contract text. Unlike P94i_3_has_place_of_enactment which indicates where the contract was created, this property represents places mentioned within the contract content. Represents the direct CIDOC-CRM relationship: E31_Document > P67_refers_to > E53_Place. This acknowledges that the place is textually present in the document without implying it is the location of the transaction or the contract's creation."@en ;
