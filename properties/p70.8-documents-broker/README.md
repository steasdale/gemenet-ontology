## üìã Property Overview

**Property Name**: `gmn:P70_8_documents_broker`

**Purpose**: Simplified property for associating a sales contract with the person named as the broker who facilitated the transaction.

**Domain**: `gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract`

**Range**: `cidoc:E21_Person`

**Role**: Brokers facilitate transactions between both buyer and seller, arranging the sale and often receiving a commission. Unlike procurators who represent one party, or guarantors who provide security, brokers are neutral facilitators.

---

## üîÑ Transformation Pattern

The simplified property:
```turtle
<contract> gmn:P70_8_documents_broker <broker_person> .
```

Transforms to:
```turtle
<contract> cidoc:P70_documents <acquisition> .
<acquisition> a cidoc:E8_Acquisition ;
    cidoc:P14_carried_out_by <broker_person> .
<broker_person> a cidoc:E21_Person ;
    cidoc:P14.1_in_the_role_of <http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300025234> .
```

The AAT URI `300025234` represents "brokers (people)".

---

## üí° Key Features

1. **Simple Data Entry**: Use one property to connect contract to broker
2. **CIDOC-CRM Compliance**: Automatically expands to proper E8_Acquisition structure
3. **Role Specification**: Automatically assigns broker role from Getty AAT
4. **Multiple Brokers**: Supports contracts with multiple brokers
5. **Neutral Facilitator**: Models broker as neutral party (unlike procurators/guarantors)

---

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Simple Broker Assignment
```turtle
<sales_contract_001> a gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract ;
    gmn:P70_8_documents_broker <person_giovanni_broker> .
```

### Multiple Brokers
```turtle
<sales_contract_002> a gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract ;
    gmn:P70_8_documents_broker <person_giovanni_broker> ,
                                <person_marco_broker> .
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Broker vs Procurator**: Brokers facilitate transactions for both parties; procurators legally represent one party
2. **Broker vs Guarantor**: Brokers arrange transactions; guarantors provide security
3. **Neutral Role**: Brokers are neutral facilitators, not advocates for either party
4. **Commission**: Brokers typically receive commission from one or both parties
5. **Medieval Context**: In Genoa, brokers (sensali) were often officially licensed

## üìö Historical Context

In medieval Genoese contracts, brokers (Italian: *sensali*) were professional intermediaries who:
- Facilitated negotiations between buyers and sellers
- Helped establish fair market prices
- Often worked as licensed professionals
- Received commissions for their services
- Were distinct from legal representatives (procurators)
- Could work on behalf of both parties simultaneously
