## üìä Implementation Summary

### What This Property Does

The `gmn:P70_5_documents_buyers_procurator` property enables data entry systems to directly associate a sales contract with the procurator (legal representative) acting on behalf of the buyer. This simplified approach is automatically transformed into the full CIDOC-CRM structure that explicitly models:

1. The **E7_Activity** representing the procurator's participation
2. The **P14_carried_out_by** relationship to the procurator person
3. The **P14.1_in_the_role_of** qualification specifying the agent role
4. The **P17_was_motivated_by** relationship linking the procurator to the buyer they represent

### Why Transformation is Necessary

Historical documents often name procurators (legal representatives) who act on behalf of buyers in property transactions. A procurator might be:
- A family member acting for an absent buyer
- A business partner representing a buyer
- A professional agent authorized to complete the purchase

The simplified property provides convenience for data entry while the transformation ensures CIDOC-CRM compliance by properly modeling:
- The participation of the procurator as an activity within the acquisition
- The relationship between the procurator and the buyer they represent
- The role specification using AAT vocabulary

### Related Properties

This property works in conjunction with:
- **gmn:P70_2_documents_buyer** - Documents the buyer (principal party)
- **gmn:P70_4_documents_sellers_procurator** - Documents the seller's procurator
- **gmn:P70_7_documents_buyers_guarantor** - Documents the buyer's guarantor (security provider)

## üîß Technical Details

### Transformation Behavior

1. **E8_Acquisition Creation**: If no acquisition exists, creates one
2. **E7_Activity Creation**: Creates unique activity for each procurator
3. **URI Generation**: Uses hash-based URI: `{contract_uri}/activity/procurator_{hash}`
4. **Buyer Linkage**: Automatically links to buyer via P17_was_motivated_by
5. **Role Specification**: Applies AAT_AGENT type to qualify the relationship
6. **Property Removal**: Deletes simplified property after transformation

### Constants Used

```python
AAT_AGENT = "http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300411835"  # Agents (people in legal context)
```

## üìö Example Usage

### Input (Simplified)

```json
{
  "@id": "https://example.org/contract/1234",
  "@type": "gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract",
  "gmn:P70_2_documents_buyer": [{
    "@id": "https://example.org/person/buyer_001",
    "@type": "cidoc:E21_Person"
  }],
  "gmn:P70_5_documents_buyers_procurator": [{
    "@id": "https://example.org/person/procurator_001",
    "@type": "cidoc:E21_Person"
  }]
}
```

### Output (Transformed)

```json
{
  "@id": "https://example.org/contract/1234",
  "@type": "gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract",
  "cidoc:P70_documents": [{
    "@id": "https://example.org/contract/1234/acquisition",
    "@type": "cidoc:E8_Acquisition",
    "cidoc:P22_transferred_title_to": [{
      "@id": "https://example.org/person/buyer_001",
      "@type": "cidoc:E21_Person"
    }],
    "cidoc:P9_consists_of": [{
      "@id": "https://example.org/contract/1234/activity/procurator_a1b2c3d4",
      "@type": "cidoc:E7_Activity",
      "cidoc:P14_carried_out_by": [{
        "@id": "https://example.org/person/procurator_001",
        "@type": "cidoc:E21_Person"
      }],
      "cidoc:P14.1_in_the_role_of": {
        "@id": "http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300411835",
        "@type": "cidoc:E55_Type"
      },
      "cidoc:P17_was_motivated_by": {
        "@id": "https://example.org/person/buyer_001",
        "@type": "cidoc:E21_Person"
      }
    }]
  }]
}

## üîç Key Concepts

### Procurator vs. Other Roles

**Procurator (Legal Representative)**
- Acts with legal authority on behalf of the buyer
- Makes binding decisions for the principal party
- Often holds power of attorney

**Guarantor (P70.7)**
- Provides security for the buyer's obligations
- Does not act on behalf of the buyer
- Promises to fulfill obligations if buyer defaults

**Payment Provider (P70.9)**
- Supplies funds for the purchase
- May not have legal authority to act for buyer
- Financial supporter rather than legal representative

### Historical Context

In Genoa and other Mediterranean commercial centers, procurators were essential for:
- Long-distance trade (buyers couldn't always be physically present)
- Family transactions (managing property for relatives)
- Professional representation (merchants employing agents)
- Legal proceedings (representation before notaries and courts)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always transform this property before serializing to pure CIDOC-CRM
- Ensure buyer (P70.2) is documented before procurator transformation
- Multiple procurators create multiple E7_Activity instances
- Each activity receives unique URI based on procurator URI hash
- Property is removed from output after transformation
