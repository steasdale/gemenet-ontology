SECTION 2: DETAILED PROPERTY DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

#### P70.7 documents buyer's guarantor

**Property URI:** gmn:P70_7_documents_buyers_guarantor

**Definition:** Associates a sales contract with one or more persons who serve 
as guarantors for the buyer in the transaction. A guarantor provides security 
or assurance by promising to fulfill the buyer's obligations if the buyer 
defaults on their commitments.

**CIDOC-CRM Semantic Path:**
```
E31_Document (Sales Contract)
  → P70_documents → E8_Acquisition
    → P9_consists_of → E7_Activity (Guaranteeing Activity)
      ├─ P14_carried_out_by → E21_Person (Guarantor)
      │   └─ P14.1_in_the_role_of → E55_Type (AAT: guarantor)
      └─ P17_was_motivated_by → E21_Person (Buyer being guaranteed)
```

**Historical Context:** 

Guarantors (also called sureties or securities) were a common feature of 
property transactions throughout medieval and early modern Europe. They served 
as a form of credit assurance when:

- The buyer's financial standing was uncertain or unproven
- The transaction involved significant value or extended payment terms
- Local customs or legal requirements mandated additional security
- The seller required additional assurance of the buyer's ability to pay

The guarantor essentially promised to "step in" and fulfill the buyer's 
obligations if the buyer failed to complete payment or otherwise defaulted. 
This could mean:

- Making outstanding payments if buyer failed to pay
- Covering penalties or damages resulting from buyer's default
- Assuming the buyer's obligations under the contract

Guarantors were typically:
- Family members (brothers, fathers, sons, uncles)
- Business partners or associates
- Individuals with known financial stability
- Members of the same guild or social network

**Distinction from Related Roles:**

Unlike procurators who had legal authority to act on behalf of the buyer, 
guarantors did not represent the buyer or have authority to make decisions. 
Unlike payment providers who supplied funds at the time of transaction, 
guarantors provided a promise of contingent future payment only if needed.

**Data Entry Guidance:**

Use this property when:
- Document explicitly names someone as "guarantor," "surety," "security," or 
  similar term for the buyer
- Person promises to fulfill buyer's obligations if buyer defaults
- Multiple persons jointly guarantee the buyer's obligations

Do NOT use this property for:
- Seller's guarantors (use P70.6 instead)
- Legal representatives/procurators (use P70.5 instead)
- Third parties who provide actual payment (use P70.9 instead)
- Transaction facilitators (use P70.8 instead)
- Witnesses (use P70.15 instead)

**Cardinality:** 0..n (zero or more guarantors per contract)

**Transformation Notes:**

This shortcut property automatically transforms into the full CIDOC-CRM 
structure during processing. Each guarantor creates a separate E7_Activity 
node within the acquisition event, with the activity explicitly linked to 
both the guarantor (via P14_carried_out_by) and the buyer being guaranteed 
(via P17_was_motivated_by). The role of "guarantor" is specified using the 
Getty AAT concept (300025614).

SECTION 3: USAGE EXAMPLES
================================================================================

### Example 1: Simple Venetian Property Sale with Family Guarantor

**Historical Scenario:**
Venice, 1467. Giovanni Mocenigo purchases a house in Cannaregio. His brother 
Marco serves as guarantor, promising to pay if Giovanni defaults.

    cidoc:P1_is_identified_by [
        cidoc:P190_has_symbolic_content "Giovanni Mocenigo"
    ] .

    a cidoc:E21_Person ;
    cidoc:P1_is_identified_by [
        cidoc:P190_has_symbolic_content "Marco Mocenigo, brother of Giovanni"
    ] .
```

**Interpretation:**
Marco Mocenigo, identified as Giovanni's brother, provides security for the 
transaction. If Giovanni fails to complete payment, Marco is obligated to 
step in and fulfill the payment obligations.

### Example 2: Commercial Sale with Multiple Business Partner Guarantors

**Historical Scenario:**
Florence, 1502. Francesco de' Medici purchases a warehouse. Three business 
associates jointly serve as guarantors: his son Giovanni, his nephew Lorenzo, 
and his brother Antonio.

**GMN Encoding:**
```turtle
<http://example.org/contract/florence_1502_128>
    a gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract ;
    cidoc:P1_is_identified_by [
        cidoc:P190_has_symbolic_content "Warehouse Purchase Contract, Florence, 1502"
    ] ;
    gmn:P70_2_documents_buyer <http://example.org/person/francesco_medici> ;
    gmn:P70_7_documents_buyers_guarantor 
        <http://example.org/person/giovanni_medici>,
        <http://example.org/person/lorenzo_medici>,
        <http://example.org/person/antonio_medici> ;
    gmn:P70_3_documents_transfer_of <http://example.org/building/florence_warehouse_128> .

<http://example.org/person/giovanni_medici>
    cidoc:P1_is_identified_by [
        cidoc:P190_has_symbolic_content "Giovanni de' Medici, son of Francesco"
    ] .

<http://example.org/person/lorenzo_medici>
    cidoc:P1_is_identified_by [
        cidoc:P190_has_symbolic_content "Lorenzo de' Medici, nephew of Francesco"
    ] .

<http://example.org/person/antonio_medici>
    cidoc:P1_is_identified_by [
        cidoc:P190_has_symbolic_content "Antonio de' Medici, brother of Francesco"
    ] .
```

**Interpretation:**
Three family members jointly guarantee Francesco's obligations. This shared 
responsibility distributes the risk and provides stronger assurance to the 
seller. Each guarantor could be held liable for the full obligation, or they 
might share it proportionally depending on the contract terms.

---

### Example 3: Transaction with Both Buyer and Seller Guarantors

**Historical Scenario:**
Genoa, 1489. Complex transaction where both parties require guarantors. 
Pietro buys from Marco, with guarantors on both sides.

**GMN Encoding:**
```turtle
<http://example.org/contract/genoa_1489_067>
    a gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract ;
    gmn:P70_1_documents_seller <http://example.org/person/marco_doria> ;
    gmn:P70_2_documents_buyer <http://example.org/person/pietro_spinola> ;
    gmn:P70_6_documents_sellers_guarantor <http://example.org/person/antonio_doria> ;
    gmn:P70_7_documents_buyers_guarantor <http://example.org/person/giovanni_spinola> ;
    gmn:P70_3_documents_transfer_of <http://example.org/building/genoa_warehouse_067> .
```

**Interpretation:**
Both parties have guarantors. Antonio Doria guarantees the seller Marco's 
obligations (likely related to clear title and delivery), while Giovanni 
Spinola guarantees the buyer Pietro's payment obligations. This mutual 
guarantee structure suggests a transaction where both parties had concerns 
about the other's ability to fulfill their obligations.

SECTION 4: COMPARISON TABLE WITH RELATED ROLES
================================================================================

### Buyer-Related Roles in Sales Contracts

| Role | Property | Function | Authority | Timing | Typical Relationship |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Buyer** | P70.2 | Receives property ownership | Full ownership rights | During/after transaction | Principal party |
| **Buyer's Procurator** | P70.5 | Acts as legal representative | Legal authority to act for buyer | During transaction | Family, business partner, lawyer |
| **Buyer's Guarantor** | P70.7 | Provides security/backup | Contingent payment obligation | If buyer defaults | Family, business partner |
| **Payment Provider** | P70.9 | Supplies purchase funds | Provides actual payment | At time of transaction | Family, creditor, partner |

### Understanding the Distinctions

**Buyer (P70.2)**
- The principal party receiving ownership
- Has full rights to the property after transfer
- Bears primary obligation for payment

**Buyer's Procurator (P70.5)**  
- Acts with buyer's authority during transaction
- Can sign documents, make decisions for buyer
- Active role during the negotiation and signing
- Example: "Giovanni, acting through his procurator Marco..."

**Buyer's Guarantor (P70.7)**
- Provides security/assurance for buyer's obligations
- Passive role unless buyer defaults
- Contingent obligation activated only if needed
- Example: "Giovanni purchases with Marco as guarantor..."

**Payment Provider (P70.9)**
- Actually provides the money at time of purchase
- Active immediate financial participation
- May be repaid by buyer later
- Example: "Giovanni purchases, with Marco providing the funds..."


================================================================================
SECTION 5: SEMANTIC PATTERN EXPLANATION
================================================================================

### Why Use E7_Activity for Guarantors?

The use of E7_Activity as an intermediate node serves several purposes:

**1. Role Clarity**
The activity allows us to specify the exact role (guarantor) through 
P14.1_in_the_role_of, distinguishing this from other forms of participation.

**2. Relationship Specificity**  
P17_was_motivated_by explicitly links the guarantor to the specific party 
(buyer) they guarantee, rather than just to the transaction as a whole.

**3. Multiple Guarantors**
Each guarantor gets their own activity node, preventing ambiguity about who 
guarantees whom when there are multiple parties and guarantors.

**4. Semantic Precision**
The activity represents the "act of guaranteeing" as distinct from the act 
of purchasing, the act of selling, or other activities within the acquisition.

**5. Query Capability**
The structure enables queries like:
- "Find all persons who acted as guarantor in any transaction"
- "Find all guarantors for a specific buyer"
- "Find all contracts where Giovanni acted as guarantor"

### Contrasting with Direct P70_documents Approach

If we had used direct P70_documents without the intermediate E7_Activity:

```
E31_Document → P70_documents → E8_Acquisition → P14_carried_out_by → E21_Person
```

We would lose:
- The explicit link to the buyer being guaranteed (no P17)
- The distinction between guaranteeing and other forms of participation
- The ability to represent the temporal nature of guaranteeing

The E7_Activity structure is semantically richer and more precise.


================================================================================
SECTION 6: HISTORICAL RESEARCH GUIDANCE
================================================================================

### Identifying Guarantors in Historical Documents

When transcribing historical contracts, look for these Latin and Italian terms:

**Latin:**
- fideiussor (guarantor, surety)
- sponsor (guarantor, bondsman)
- vindex (guarantor, security provider)
- praes (surety, bail)
- pleges dare (to give sureties)

**Italian:**
- mallevadore (guarantor)
- fideiussore (guarantor)
- sicurtà (security)
- garante (guarantor)

**Typical Phrases:**
- "cum fideiussore [name]" (with guarantor [name])
- "et pro eo/ea fideiussit [name]" (and for him/her guaranteed [name])
- "[name] se fecit fideiussorem" ([name] made himself guarantor)
- "habentem fideiussorem [name]" (having as guarantor [name])

### Common Patterns in Documents

1. **Family Guarantors:**
   "Giovanni filius quondam Marci, cum fideiussore Marco fratre suo"
   (Giovanni son of the late Marco, with his brother Marco as guarantor)

2. **Multiple Guarantors:**
   "cum fideiussoribus Petro et Antonio"
   (with Pietro and Antonio as guarantors)

3. **Guarantor Obligations:**
   "promittens solvere si dictus emptor non solverit"
   (promising to pay if the said buyer does not pay)

4. **Mutual Guarantees:**
   Documents sometimes specify guarantors for both buyer and seller, indicating 
   mutual distrust or high-value transactions requiring extra security.


================================================================================
SECTION 7: DATA QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

### Validation Checks

When entering P70.7 data, verify:

**Required Consistency:**
- [ ] If guarantor specified, buyer (P70.2) should also be present
- [ ] Guarantor should be E21_Person (not organization or thing)
- [ ] Same person should not be both buyer and guarantor (rare but check)

**Recommended Data:**
- [ ] Guarantor has cidoc:P1_is_identified_by with name
- [ ] Relationship to buyer noted (brother, son, partner, etc.)
- [ ] Multiple guarantors each have unique URIs

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Don't confuse guarantors with procurators
- Don't use for witnesses (even if they "guarantee" transaction validity)
- Don't duplicate same person as guarantor
- Don't mix buyer's and seller's guarantors in same property

### Edge Cases

**Case 1: Guarantor Withdraws**
If document mentions guarantor later withdrew, create separate contract 
revision or note in rdfs:comment rather than removing guarantor from original.

**Case 2: Guarantor Called Upon**
If historical records show guarantor had to fulfill obligations, this is a 
separate event (E7_Activity) that should be documented independently, not in 
the original contract.

**Case 3: Conditional Guarantees**
If guarantee is conditional ("only if payment exceeds X ducats"), note this 
in rdfs:comment on the guarantor person or in separate documentation.
