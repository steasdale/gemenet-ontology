This can include rights to collect debts, rights to use property (usufruct), rights of ownership over some object, claims arising from other contracts, inheritance rights, or any other legal interests. Represents the full CIDOC-CRM path: E31_Document > P70_documents > E7_Activity > P16_used_specific_object > E72_Legal_Object. The E7_Activity should be typed as a cession/transfer of rights (AAT 300417639). This property is provided as a convenience for data entry and should be transformed to the full CIDOC-CRM structure for formal compliance. The range is E72_Legal_Object, which encompasses rights, obligations, and legal claims."@en ;
