## üéØ Quick Start

### What is P22.1?

`gmn:P22_1_has_owner` is a simplified property for expressing ownership of buildings or moveable property by a person. It represents the full CIDOC-CRM path:

```
E22_Human-Made_Object 
  ‚Üí P24i_changed_ownership_through 
    ‚Üí E8_Acquisition 
      ‚Üí P22_transferred_title_to 
        ‚Üí E21_Person
```

### Key Features

- **Domain**: `cidoc:E22_Human-Made_Object` (buildings and moveable property)
- **Range**: `cidoc:E21_Person`
- **Subproperty of**: `cidoc:P24i_changed_ownership_through`
- **Creates**: E8_Acquisition event for each ownership relationship
- **Applies to**: Both `gmn:E22_1_Building` and `gmn:E22_2_Moveable_Property`

## ‚úÖ Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Ontology Update
- [ ] Add P22.1 property definition to `gmn_ontology.ttl`
- [ ] Verify property label and comment
- [ ] Check domain and range restrictions
- [ ] Confirm subproperty relationship
- [ ] Validate with Prot√©g√© or other RDF validator

### Phase 2: Transformation Script
- [ ] Add `transform_p22_1_has_owner()` function to `gmn_to_cidoc_transform.py`
- [ ] Add function call to `transform_item()` pipeline
- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Verify URI generation logic
- [ ] Confirm acquisition event structure

### Phase 3: Documentation
- [ ] Add property description to main documentation
- [ ] Include usage examples
- [ ] Add transformation examples
- [ ] Update property reference table
- [ ] Document relationship to related properties

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] Test with single owner
- [ ] Test with multiple owners
- [ ] Test with building ownership
- [ ] Test with moveable property ownership
- [ ] Verify URI uniqueness across multiple owners
- [ ] Check roundtrip conversion

## üéì Understanding the Transformation

### Why Use E8_Acquisition?

The transformation creates an E8_Acquisition event to properly model ownership in CIDOC-CRM:

1. **Event-Based Modeling**: CIDOC-CRM models relationships through events
2. **Temporal Context**: Acquisitions can have time-spans (when ownership was acquired)
3. **Rich Context**: Can be expanded with location, witnesses, payment details, etc.
4. **Standards Compliance**: Follows CIDOC-CRM best practices for ownership modeling

### URI Generation Strategy

Each ownership relationship gets a unique acquisition URI:
- Base: Object URI + `/acquisition/ownership_`
- Hash: Last 8 characters of hash(owner_uri + 'ownership')
- Example: `<building001/acquisition/ownership_a1b2c3d4>`

This ensures:
- Unique URIs for each owner-object pair
- Consistent URIs across transformations
- Collision resistance for multiple owners

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Distinction from Occupation

- **P22.1 (Has Owner)**: Legal ownership of property
- **P53.1 (Has Occupant)**: Physical residence/occupation without ownership
- These are **different relationships** and should not be confused

### Applies to Human-Made Objects Only

This property is specifically for:
- Buildings (`gmn:E22_1_Building`)
- Moveable property (`gmn:E22_2_Moveable_Property`)

Do not use for:
- Land parcels (use appropriate land ownership properties)
- Natural features
- Abstract concepts

### Multiple Owners

When multiple owners are specified, each gets their own E8_Acquisition event. This allows for:
- Different acquisition dates per owner (if data available)
- Different ownership contexts
- Independent modeling of each ownership relationship
