====================
USAGE TIPS FOR DATA ENTRY
====================

1. MINIMUM REQUIRED PROPERTIES:
   - P70.1 (seller)
   - P70.2 (buyer)
   - P70.3 (property transferred)
   
   Without these three, the contract cannot be properly modeled.

2. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PROPERTIES:
   - P70.16 (price amount)
   - P70.17 (price currency)
   - P94i_2 (enactment date)
   - P94i_1 (notary)
   
   These provide essential context for sales transactions.

3. PROPERTY ORDERING IN OMEKA-S TEMPLATE:
   Organize properties by function for easier data entry:
   - Core transaction (P70.1-3)
   - Price (P70.16-17)
   - Legal representatives (P70.4-7)
   - Facilitators (P70.8-10, 12)
   - References (P70.11, 13-15)

4. COMMON DATA ENTRY ERRORS:
   - Forgetting to link rather than type names
   - Using P70.11 (referenced person) for active participants
   - Entering price without currency (or vice versa)
   - Confusing procurators and guarantors

5. CREATING LINKED RESOURCES FIRST:
   Always create these before the contract:
   - Buyer (as Person)
   - Seller (as Person)
   - Property being sold (as Building or Moveable Property)
   - Currency (if not already in system)
   - All other actors mentioned

6. HANDLING MULTIPLE ACTORS:
   - Multiple sellers: Add each as separate P70.1 entry
   - Multiple buyers: Add each as separate P70.2 entry
   - Multiple witnesses: Add each as separate P70.15 entry
   - Each will be properly handled in transformation
