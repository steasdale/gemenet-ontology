This is a specialized type of gmn:E31_1_Contract used to represent legal documents that record the sale and transfer of property (both real estate and moveable property) between parties. Sales contracts typically include information about the buyer, seller, property being transferred, price, date of transaction, and witnessing notaries. Instances of this class represent the physical or conceptual document itself, while the actual transfer of ownership is modeled through E8_Acquisition events that the document documents (via P70_documents)."@en ;
