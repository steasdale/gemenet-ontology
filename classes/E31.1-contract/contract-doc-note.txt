# E31.1 General Contract - Documentation Additions

## Overview

This file contains text snippets, examples, and tables that can be added to the main Genoese Merchant Networks project documentation to explain the E31_1_Contract class and its role in the ontology.

## Section 1: Contract Class Hierarchy Overview

### Text to Add

The GMN ontology includes a comprehensive hierarchy of contract document classes that model the various types of notarial contracts found in medieval and early modern Genoese records. At the foundation of this hierarchy is **gmn:E31_1_Contract**, which serves as the parent class for all specialized contract types.

#### The General Contract Class (E31_1_Contract)

**gmn:E31_1_Contract** is a specialized type of CIDOC-CRM's E31_Document that represents notarial contract documents in general. This class serves primarily as a parent class for more specific contract types, providing common structure and properties that all contracts share.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Subclass of**: cidoc:E31_Document
- **Purpose**: Parent class for specialized contract types
- **Role**: Provides common document structure for all contracts
- **Instantiation**: Rarely instantiated directly; most contracts use specialized subclasses
- **Properties**: Uses standard document properties inherited from cidoc:E31_Document

**Fundamental Principle - Document vs. Transaction:**

A critical distinction in the contract modeling is the separation between the document and the transaction:

- **The Contract (E31_1_Contract)**: The physical or conceptual document - the notarial record itself
- **The Transaction (E8_Acquisition, E7_Activity)**: The actual transfer or agreement documented by the contract

These are connected via the `cidoc:P70_documents` property, ensuring that the documentary evidence is modeled separately from the events it records.

#### Specialized Contract Types

The GMN ontology defines several specialized contract types as subclasses of E31_1_Contract:

1. **E31.2 Sales Contract** (gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract)
   - Purpose: Documents the sale and purchase of property (real estate and moveable goods)
   - Transaction Type: E8_Acquisition (ownership transfer)
   - Key Properties: seller, buyer, sale price

2. **E31.3 Arbitration Agreement** (gmn:E31_3_Arbitration_Agreement)
   - Purpose: Documents agreements to submit disputes to arbitration
   - Transaction Type: E7_Activity (arbitration process)
   - Key Properties: disputing parties, arbitrator(s), dispute subject

3. **E31.4 Cession of Rights Contract** (gmn:E31_4_Cession_of_Rights_Contract)
   - Purpose: Documents transfers of legal rights, claims, and obligations
   - Transaction Type: E7_Activity (rights transfer)
   - Key Properties: conceding party, receiving party, object of cession

4. **E31.7 Donation Contract** (gmn:E31_7_Donation_Contract)
   - Purpose: Documents gratuitous transfers of property without expectation of payment
   - Transaction Type: E8_Acquisition (gift transfer)
   - Key Properties: donor, receiving party (donee), object of donation

5. **E31.8 Dowry Contract** (gmn:E31_8_Dowry_Contract)
   - Purpose: Documents transfers of property in the context of marriage arrangements
   - Transaction Type: E8_Acquisition (dowry transfer)
   - Key Properties: donor, receiving party, object of dowry

### Table: Contract Type Comparison

| Class | Label | Transaction | Specialized Properties | Use When |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------------|----------|
| E31.1 | General Contract | Varies | None (uses document properties only) | Contract type unclear or doesn't fit categories |
| E31.2 | Sales Contract | E8_Acquisition | P70.14 (seller), P70.15 (buyer), P70.16-17 (price) | Recording property sales |
| E31.3 | Arbitration Agreement | E7_Activity | P70.18-19 (parties/arbitrator), P70.20 (subject) | Recording dispute resolution agreements |
| E31.4 | Cession Contract | E7_Activity | P70.21 (conceding), P70.22 (receiving), P70.23 (object) | Recording transfers of legal rights |
| E31.7 | Donation Contract | E8_Acquisition | P70.32 (donor), P70.22 (receiving), P70.33 (object) | Recording gifts and donations |
| E31.8 | Dowry Contract | E8_Acquisition | P70.32 (donor), P70.22 (receiving), P70.34 (object) | Recording marriage-related property transfers |

## Section 2: Using Contract Classes

### Best Practices for Contract Classification

When recording contracts in the database, follow these guidelines:

1. **Always prefer the most specific contract type available**
   - If recording a sale, use E31_2_Sales_Contract, not E31_1_Contract
   - If recording a donation, use E31_7_Donation_Contract, not E31_1_Contract
   - And so on for other contract types

2. **Use E31_1_Contract only when**:
   - The contract type is genuinely unclear from the source
   - The contract represents a complex arrangement not fitting standard categories
   - You plan to determine the specific type later through expert analysis
   - You're creating a temporary record for a damaged or illegible contract

3. **Document classification decisions**:
   - Use the P3.1 editorial note property to explain why a general contract class was used
   - Include information about what makes the classification uncertain
   - Note any plans for future reclassification

### Example Workflow

**Step 1: Examine the Contract**
- Read the contract text or description
- Identify the main parties and their roles
- Determine the type of transaction being documented

**Step 2: Select the Appropriate Class**
- Is property being sold for money? → E31_2_Sales_Contract
- Is property being given as a gift? → E31_7_Donation_Contract
- Is property part of a marriage arrangement? → E31_8_Dowry_Contract
- Is it a dispute resolution? → E31_3_Arbitration_Agreement
- Are legal rights being transferred? → E31_4_Cession_of_Rights_Contract
- None of the above or unclear? → E31_1_Contract

**Step 3: Use Appropriate Properties**
- For specialized types: Use the specialized shortcut properties
- For general contracts: Use only standard document properties
- Always include: name, notary, date, place, register reference

## Section 3: Properties for Contract Documentation

### Standard Document Properties (All Contract Types)

All contracts, whether general (E31_1_Contract) or specialized, can use these standard properties:

#### Identification

- **P1.1 has name** (gmn:P1_1_has_name)
  - Purpose: Readable name for the contract
  - Example: "Sale of house on Via San Lorenzo by Giovanni Doria"
  - Required: Strongly recommended

- **P102.1 has title** (gmn:P102_1_has_title)
  - Purpose: Formal title, often in Latin
  - Example: "Contractus venditionis domus in civitate Janue"
  - Required: Optional, use when available from source

#### Creation Information

- **P94i.1 was created by** (gmn:P94i_1_was_created_by)
  - Purpose: Links to the notary who recorded the contract
  - Value: Link to notary person resource
  - Required: Strongly recommended

- **P94i.2 has enactment date** (gmn:P94i_2_has_enactment_date)
  - Purpose: Date when contract was enacted/recorded
  - Value: xsd:date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Required: Required when known

- **P94i.3 has place of enactment** (gmn:P94i_3_has_place_of_enactment)
  - Purpose: Location where contract was drawn up
  - Value: Link to place resource
  - Required: Strongly recommended

#### Context

- **P46i.1 is contained in** (gmn:P46i_1_is_contained_in)
  - Purpose: Links to the notarial register containing the contract
  - Value: Link to register resource
  - Required: Required when contract is from a register

- **P70 documents** (cidoc:P70_documents)
  - Purpose: Links to the transaction/event documented by the contract
  - Value: Link to E8_Acquisition or E7_Activity resource
  - Required: Required for complete CIDOC-CRM compliance
  - Note: Shortcut properties create this automatically

#### Annotation

- **P3.1 has editorial note** (gmn:P3_1_has_editorial_note)
  - Purpose: Internal notes about the contract
  - Example: "Text partially damaged; classification uncertain"
  - Required: Optional, for project internal use

### Property Usage Table

| Property | Applies To | Required | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| P1.1 has name | All contracts | Strongly Recommended | Readable identifier |
| P102.1 has title | All contracts | Optional | Formal title from source |
| P94i.1 was created by | All contracts | Strongly Recommended | Notary information |
| P94i.2 has enactment date | All contracts | Required (when known) | Date of creation |
| P94i.3 has place of enactment | All contracts | Strongly Recommended | Location of creation |
| P46i.1 is contained in | All contracts | Required (when in register) | Register containment |
| P70 documents | All contracts | Required | Link to transaction |
| P3.1 has editorial note | All contracts | Optional | Internal annotation |

## Section 4: Examples

### Example 1: Using General Contract Class

When a contract's type is unclear:

```
Resource Type: General Contract (gmn:E31_1_Contract)
Name: "Unclassified contract from Register Basso, August 1455"
Created by: Notary Antonio Basso
Enactment Date: 1455-08-12
Place of Enactment: Genoa, Piazza Banchi
Contained in: Register of Antonio Basso, 1455
Editorial Note: "Contract type unclear from available transcription. Appears to involve transfer of some kind but parties and object not fully legible. Requires examination of original manuscript for proper classification."
```

### Example 2: Using Specialized Type (Preferred)

When the contract type is clear:

```
Resource Type: Sales Contract (gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract)
Name: "Sale of house in Genoa by Maria Doria to Giovanni Spinola"
Title: "Contractus venditionis domus"
Seller: Maria Doria
Buyer: Giovanni Spinola
Sale Price: 500.00 Lire Genovesi
Created by: Notary Antonio Basso
Enactment Date: 1455-08-12
Place of Enactment: Genoa
Contained in: Register of Antonio Basso, 1455
```

### Example 3: Donation Contract

```
Resource Type: Donation Contract (gmn:E31_7_Donation_Contract)
Name: "Donation of vineyard by Giacomo Spinola to Santa Maria Church"
Donor: Giacomo Spinola q. Antonio
Receiving Party: Church of Santa Maria di Castello
Object of Donation: Vineyard in Albaro
Created by: Notary Giovanni Basso
Enactment Date: 1455-06-20
Place of Enactment: Genoa
Editorial Note: "Pro remedio animae - donation for salvation of donor's soul"
```

## Section 5: Understanding Inheritance

### How Contract Inheritance Works

The contract class hierarchy uses object-oriented inheritance patterns:

```
cidoc:E31_Document (CIDOC-CRM standard)
  │
  │ Properties inherited by all documents:
  │ - Can have names, titles, creators
  │ - Can be contained in other documents
  │ - Can document events/entities
  │
  └── gmn:E31_1_Contract (GMN extension)
      │
      │ Adds contract-specific semantics:
      │ - Specializes for notarial contracts
      │ - Serves as parent for specialized types
      │ - Uses standard document properties
      │
      ├── gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract
      │   │ Adds sales-specific properties:
      │   │ - P70.14 indicates seller
      │   │ - P70.15 indicates buyer
      │   │ - P70.16-17 documents sale price
      │   └── Inherits all document properties
      │
      ├── gmn:E31_7_Donation_Contract
      │   │ Adds donation-specific properties:
      │   │ - P70.32 indicates donor
      │   │ - P70.22 indicates receiving party
      │   │ - P70.33 indicates object of donation
      │   └── Inherits all document properties
      │
      └── [Other specialized types...]
```

### What This Means for Users

1. **All contracts can use document properties**: Whether you use E31_1_Contract or a specialized type, you can always use properties like P1.1 (name), P94i.1 (created by), P94i.2 (enactment date), etc.

2. **Specialized types add specific properties**: When you use E31_2_Sales_Contract, you get access to additional properties like "indicates seller" and "indicates buyer" that aren't available on the general E31_1_Contract.

3. **Queries can be general or specific**: You can query for all contracts (any subclass of E31_1_Contract) or for specific types only (just sales contracts, just donations, etc.)

## Section 6: CIDOC-CRM Compliance

### Transformation to Standard CIDOC-CRM

The GMN ontology uses shortcut properties for data entry convenience, but these are transformed into full CIDOC-CRM compliant structures for formal semantic compliance.

#### Document-Transaction Separation

**Input (simplified GMN format)**:
```
Contract: gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract
- Name: "Sale of house"
- Seller: Giovanni
- Buyer: Marco
- Created by: Notary Antonio
- Date: 1450-03-15
```

**Output (CIDOC-CRM compliant)**:
```
Contract Document: gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract
└─ cidoc:P70_documents → Acquisition Event: cidoc:E8_Acquisition
   ├─ P23_transferred_title_from → Giovanni (seller)
   ├─ P22_transferred_title_to → Marco (buyer)
   └─ P24_transferred_title_of → House

Contract Document: gmn:E31_2_Sales_Contract
└─ cidoc:P94i_was_created_by → Creation Event: cidoc:E65_Creation
   ├─ P14_carried_out_by → Notary Antonio
   └─ P4_has_time-span → Time-Span: cidoc:E52_Time-Span
      └─ P82_at_some_time_within → 1450-03-15
```

This transformation ensures:
- Document creation is modeled separately from the transaction
- Notary information is associated with document creation, not the transaction
- Transaction participants (buyer, seller) are associated with the acquisition event
- Full CIDOC-CRM semantic precision is maintained

## Section 7: Common Questions

### Q: When should I use E31_1_Contract vs. a specialized type?

**A**: Almost always use the specialized type when one fits. Only use E31_1_Contract when:
- The contract type is genuinely unclear
- You're creating a temporary record
- The contract represents a complex arrangement not fitting standard categories

### Q: Can I assign multiple contract types to one resource?

**A**: No. Each contract should have one specific type. If a contract has characteristics of multiple types, choose the most specific one that fits best and document the complexity in an editorial note.

### Q: What if I realize I used the wrong contract type?

**A**: You can change the resource type in Omeka-S. Update the type and adjust the properties accordingly (add specialized properties if moving to a specialized type, or remove them if moving to general type).

### Q: Do general contracts (E31_1_Contract) use any specialized properties?

**A**: No. E31_1_Contract instances should only use standard document properties like name, title, created by, date, place, etc. Specialized properties belong only to specialized contract types.

### Q: How do I query for all contracts regardless of type?

**A**: Use a SPARQL query that includes subclass relationships:
```sparql
SELECT ?contract WHERE {
    ?contract a/rdfs:subClassOf* gmn:E31_1_Contract .
}
```

This will return instances of E31_1_Contract and all its subclasses.
