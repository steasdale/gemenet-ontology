    rdfs:comment "Specialized class that describes declaration documents. This is a specialized type of cidoc:E31_Document used to represent legal documents where one party (the declarant) makes a formal statement, acknowledgment, or assertion to another party (the recipient) regarding a specific subject matter. Declarations can be either notarial documents (recorded by a notary) or governmental documents (issued by official authorities without notarial involvement). Common types include declarations of debt, acknowledgments of obligations, statements of fact, official pronouncements, formal notifications, or governmental decrees. Unlike contracts (E31.1) which typically involve bilateral agreements, declarations are unilateral statements, though they have legal effect and may create or acknowledge obligations. Some declarations may be recorded in notarial registers alongside contracts, while others exist as independent governmental or administrative documents. Instances of this class represent the physical or conceptual document itself, while the actual declaration activity and its effects are modeled through E7_Activity that the document documents (via P70_documents)."@en ;
