    rdfs:comment "Specialized class that describes dowry contract documents. This is a specialized type of gmn:E31_1_Contract used to represent legal documents that record the transfer of property (dowry) from a donor to a person receiving the dowry, typically in the context of marriage arrangements. Like all notarial contracts in this ontology, dowry contracts model the transfer of rights: the donor agrees or obliges themselves to transfer an object of dowry to the person receiving the dowry. Dowry contracts typically include information about the donor (often a parent or family member), the recipient (often the spouse or the couple), the property being transferred as dowry, any conditions attached to the transfer, date of transaction, and witnessing notaries. Instances of this class represent the physical or conceptual document itself, while the actual transfer of ownership is modeled through E8_Acquisition events that the document documents (via P70_documents)."@en ;
