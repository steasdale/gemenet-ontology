    rdfs:comment "Specialized class that describes donation contract documents. This is a specialized type of gmn:E31_1_Contract used to represent legal documents that record the gratuitous transfer of property (both real estate and moveable property) from a donor to a donee (recipient). Unlike sales contracts where transfer occurs in exchange for payment, donation contracts document voluntary transfers without expectation of compensation, though they may include conditions or stipulations. Like all notarial contracts in this ontology, donation contracts model the transfer of rights: the donor agrees or obliges themselves to transfer an object of donation to the person receiving the donation. Donation contracts typically include information about the donor, donee, property being donated, any conditions attached to the donation, date of transaction, and witnessing notaries. Instances of this class represent the physical or conceptual document itself, while the actual transfer of ownership is modeled through E8_Acquisition events that the document documents (via P70_documents)."@en ;
